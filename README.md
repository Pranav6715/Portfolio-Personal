Portfolio  Using HTML CSS 


This portfolio showcases a collection of my work and skills using a clean and visually appealing design. The layout is structured using HTML, with CSS used to style the various elements, including fonts, colors, and spacing. JavaScript is utilized to enhance the portfolio by adding interactive elements such as animations, dynamic content display, and smooth scrolling. Although non-clickable, this portfolio presents a concise overview of my projects and expertise, providing a glimpse into my abilities as a web developer. You Can Also Add Your own ideas to implement the project. you can also add other sections like certification Skills etc. i also used java script to animate portfolio.
